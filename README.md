The Random Synth is an polyphonic audio synthesizer that plays one or more random notes at an interval.

The note(s) can be quantized into a key and different harmonies, major, minor, chromatic, pentatone etc.

Portamento gives a gliding transition between the notes.

The Envelope shapes the dynamics of the notes.

The timbre of the notes is controlled by 9 overtone sliders

It has 10 presets out-of-the-box.

The UI is written in Svelte.
